# Calulator

- This was the longest assignment so far, it took me just over 2 days to complete, the hardest part of this challenge was creating the user interface.
- I have found that I can usually solve problems relating to javascript through a google search, however when it comes to CSS and HTML, I am struggling to decide whether to use grid of flex for example. I am not confident enough to make decisions without risking making a mistake. I feel as though I am too scared of making mistakes, this is a negative as making mistakes will only allow me to learn from them.
- I have come to the conclusion that creating the UI first makes a lot more sense as it is much easier to visualise the code working as opposed to writing functions one cannot see the result of (the console is available and is great for debugging, but seeing the results working within the UI makes more sense to me)

This was an extremely fun assignment, I remember when I first started learning Python, I always saw people suggesting creating a calculator and creating an interface in tkinter, but I always fled from the idea as I wasn't sure where to begin.
